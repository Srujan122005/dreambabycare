Good morning/afternoon.
My name is Srujan S S, founder of Dream Baby Care.
We are building an India-first newborn care platform that helps parents track baby routines for free and access affordable doctor consultation and expert guidance through a simple digital platform.

In India, new parents struggle with newborn care — tracking feeding, sleep, diaper routines, and remembering medical schedules.
Existing baby-care apps are mostly US-focused, expensive, and complex, and they don’t support Indian languages or affordable doctor access.
Parents end up using notebooks, WhatsApp messages, and multiple apps — which is stressful and inefficient

*There is no single affordable, Indian-focused platform that provides:
*Free baby tracking
*guidance in Indian languages
*Low-cost doctor consultation
*Simple UI designed for Indian parents

Dream Baby Care solves this by offering:
*Free baby tracking for feeding, sleep, diaper, growth, and reminders
*Free baby-care tips in Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English
*A Premium plan at just ₹99 per month, which includes:
*Doctor voice and video consultation
*Expert baby-care videos
*A shopping section that redirects parents to Blinkit for baby essentials
*This keeps core care free, while premium users pay only for expert services.
